# What is diabete

Diabete is a chronic disease caused by insulin disfunctions in the body. 
It can be due to the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body not using the insulin properly.
Insulin is the hormon that regulates blood sugar. People suffering of diabete have hyperglycemia: too high level of sugar in their blood.
Hyperglycemia can seriously damage the nerves and vessels when it is not treated.[[1]](#1)

Diabete is a disease affecting more and more people across the world (425 million in 2017[[2]](#2)). An estimated 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes in 2016.
Even more deaths are indirectly linked to that condition.
It makes it one of the leading cause of deaths in the world.

## Type I and type II diabete

Type I diabete corresponds to a deficience of insulin production by the pancreas. It requires daily administration of insulin.
It is generally diagnosed during childhood.
Type II generally happens later, due to excess body weight, junk food and lack of physical activity. In that case, the body is ineffective in using the insulin.

In both cases, the treatment involves controlling the blood glucose. Type I patients require insulin injections, while type II patients take oral medication (they may also require insulin at an advanced stage of the disease).

## How is glycemia regulated by the body?

All body cells consume glucose to function. Glucose comes from the digestion of food and it is delivered to the cells through the blood. Some part of that glucose is stored in the body (liver, muscles, adipose tissues) and delivered in the blood when needed.

Several organs intervene in glucose storage:

- the liver: his is the main organ responsible for the glycemia regulation. It stores the carbohydrates coming from digestion and delivers it to the body when needed. About 75% of the glucose that circulates in the body comes from the liver.

- the kidneys: they produce about 25% of the glucose. They deliver it during the post absorptive phase (after digestion).

- intestines: they store a limited amount of glucose in some special conditions (e.g. fasting).

All the organs use glucose to work. The brain uses 50%, the muscles 15%, the red blood cells 10%, the kidneys 10% and the adipose tissues 5%, while the rest uses about 10%.

The glucose regulation not only operates with the liver, it also depends on hormones produced by the pancreas.
These hormones are the insulin and the glucagon. They have both antogonistic roles. 
The **insuline** prevents the organs to deliver glucose in the blood, thus allowing the organs to absorb it and reudce the blood sugar level. 
The **glucagon** leads to increasing the quantity of glucose in the blood.
Any disfunction in hormones production thus affects blood sugar regulation.

## Glucose control

Diabetic people monitor their glucose level several times per day. 
They generally take a small drop of blood from their fingers with a lancet and use a glucose reader to get the value. 
Knowing the glucose level helps the patient regulates its treatment and control its blood sugar.

In the last years, several less invasive new devices have been released to facilitate glycemia control.
This is a non exhaustive list of systems that are already commercialized:

- [FreeStyle Libre](https://www.freestylelibre.fr/libre/): developed by Abbott Diabetes Care, the patch can be worn up to 14 days. It measure the glucose level in the interstitial fluid under the skin. Such technology is not as accurate as using blood test but it allows painless and continuous glucose monitoring.

- [Dexcom G5](https://www.dexcom.com/fr-FR): developed by Dexcom. It measure the glucose level in the interstitial fluid under the skin as well. The measurement is done every 5 minutes.

- [Guardian Connect](https://guardianconnect.medtronic-diabete.com/a-propos-de-cgm) developed by Medtronic. It uses the same technology as above. The sensor can be worn up to 6 days.

- [Eversense](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/): developed by Senseonics. It is a subcutaneous sensor that can last up to 90 days. It measures the glucose in the interstitial fluid under the skin.

- [GlucoTrack](http://www.glucotrack.com/): developed by Integrity Applications. It works with a sensor that is clipped on the ear and it combines ultrasonic, electromagnetic and thermal waves to estimate the glucose level.

Other systems are under development or clinical trial:

- [SugarBeat](https://nemauramedical.com/sugarbeat/): is being developed by Nemaura Medical. It is in the first phase of commercial launch. It is using similar technology as FreeStyle Libre, reading the interstitial fluid with a patch applied on the skin.

- [GlucoWise](https://gluco-wise.com/): is not commercialized yet, it is being developed by META. It relies on radio waves technology using a sensor that can be applied to the fingers or earlobe skin. Compared to other devices, the reading is thus manual.

- [GlucoSense](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/site/custom_scripts/profile-single.php?profileTypeID=&categoryID=2000&profileID=116): is developed by Genexo. It is based on a laser technology. It is non invasive and reads the glucose level on demand in 30 seconds.

### What is normal glycemia?

Glycemia level depends on many different factors, like what you eat, what you do (physical activity, sleeping), your temperatuure... In the first 4 hours after eating (postprandial), the glycemia should be between 100-140 mg/dL. More than 4 hours after eating (post absorptive phase), the glycemia should drop between 60-100 mg/dL.

Glycemia below 60 mg/dL is called hypoglycemia, while a glycemia superior to 140 mg/dL is called hyperglycemia.

Diabetic people who are not treated correctly read much higher values, higher that 200 mg/dL in postprandial phase and higher than 140 mg/dL in post absorptive phase.

## How to treat type I diabete

Type I diabete is treated using subcutaneous injection of insulin.
Very rarely, patients can be transplanted with a new pancreas or pancreatic islets (endocrine cells). This type of procedure is risky.

Insulin injection aims at simulating normal insulin secretion in the body. TThe patients may have to inject insulin several times per day (1 to 5 times) depending on the severity and lifestyle.
Two types of insulin are generally injected: basal and prandial. Basal insulin simulates insulin secretion between meals and during night, while prandial insulin simulates insulin secretion after eating. 
Basal insulin starts acting about 1h30 after injection and it acts for up to 24 hours. It is injected generally once a day.
Prandial insulin starts reacting a few minutes after injection and reaches a pic between 1 and 3 hours later. Then it clears rapidly.
There is another type of intermediary insuline that's a mix of the fast and slow-acting insulins.
