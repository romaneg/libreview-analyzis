# What is diabete

Diabete is a chronic disease caused by insulin disfunctions in the body. 
It can be due to the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body not using the insulin properly.
Insulin is the hormon that regulates blood sugar. People suffering of diabete have hyperglycemia: too high level of sugar in their blood.
Hyperglycemia can seriously damage the nerves and vessels when it is not treated.[[1]](#1)

Diabete is a disease affecting more and more people across the world (425 million in 2017[[2]](#2)). An estimated 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes in 2016.
Even more deaths are indirectly linked to that condition.
It makes it one of the leading cause of deaths in the world.

## Type I and type II diabete

Type I diabete corresponds to a deficience of insulin production by the pancreas. It requires daily administration of insulin.
It is generally diagnosed during childhood.
Type II generally happens later, due to excess body weight, junk food and lack of physical activity. In that case, the body is ineffective in using the insulin.

In both cases, the treatment involves controlling the blood glucose. Type I patients require insulin injections, while type II patients take oral medication (they may also require insulin at an advanced stage of the disease).

## Glucose control

Diabetic people monitor their glucose level several times per day. 
They generally take a small drop of blood from their fingers with a lancet and use a glucose reader to get the value. 
Knowing the glucose level helps the patient regulates its treatment and control its blood sugar.

In the last years, several less invasive new devices have been released to facilitate glycemia control.
This is a non exhaustive list of systems that are already commercialized:

- [FreeStyle Libre](https://www.freestylelibre.fr/libre/): developed by Abbott Diabetes Care, the patch can be worn up to 14 days. It measure the glucose level in the interstitial fluid under the skin. Such technology is not as accurate as using blood test but it allows painless and continuous glucose monitoring.

- [Eversense](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/): developed by Senseonics. It is a subcutaneous sensor that can last up to 90 days. It measures the glucose in the interstitial fluid under the skin.

- [GlucoTrack](http://www.glucotrack.com/): developed by Integrity Applications. It works with a sensor that is clipped on the ear and it combines ultrasonic, electromagnetic and thermal waves to estimate the glucose level.

Other systems are under development or clinical trial:

- [SugarBeat](https://nemauramedical.com/sugarbeat/): is being developed by Nemaura Medical. It is in the first phase of commercial launch. It is using similar technology as FreeStyle Libre, reading the interstitial fluid with a patch applied on the skin.

- [GlucoWise](https://gluco-wise.com/): is not commercialized yet, it is being developed by META. It relies on radio waves technology using a sensor that can be applied to the fingers or earlobe skin. Compared to other devices, the reading is thus manual.

- [GlucoSense](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/site/custom_scripts/profile-single.php?profileTypeID=&categoryID=2000&profileID=116): is developed by Genexo. It is based on a laser technology. It is non invasive and reads the glucose level on demand in 30 seconds.

### What is normal glycemia?

Glycemia level depends on many different factors, like what you eat, what you do (physical activity, sleeping), your temperatuure... In the first 4 hours after eating (postprandial), the glycemia should be between 100-140 mg/dL. More than 4 hours after eating (post absorptive phase), the glycemia should drop between 60-100 mg/dL.

Diabetic people who are not treated correctly read much higher values, higher that 200 mg/dL in postprandial phase and higher than 140 mg/dL in post absorptive phase.
